# flight-analysis

This repo includes a first-principles rocket flight simulator including Kalman filtering (as a submodule from `aditya-sengupta/rocket-simulation.git`) and records of flight reconstruction from onboard sensors.

Note that 	`rocket.simulation.git` has its own submodule, so make sure to run `git submodule update --remote --recursive` whenever you `git pull` from this repo.
