# flight-analysis

This repo includes a first-principles rocket flight simulator including Kalman filtering (as a submodule from `aditya-sengupta/rocket-simulation.git`) and records of flight reconstruction from onboard sensors.

Make sure to run `git submodule update --remote` whenever you `git pull` from this repo, so that any updates to rocket-simulation are included.
